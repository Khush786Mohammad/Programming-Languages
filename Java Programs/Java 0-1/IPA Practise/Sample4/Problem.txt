Problem4:

create the class Course with the below Attributes.

courseId- int
courseName- String
courseAdmin- String
quiz- int
handson -int

The above methods should be private ,write getter and
setter and parametrized constructor as required.

create class courseProgram with main method.

implement two static methods-
   
findAvgOfQuizByAdmin method:this method will take array
of Course objects and a String  value as input parameters.
This method will find out Average (as int) of Quiz questions
for given Course Admin (String parametre passed)
This method will return Average if found.if there is no course
that matches then the method should return 0.

sortCourseByHandsOn method:
This method will take an Array of Course Objects and int
value as input parameters.
This methods should return an Array of Course objects in an
ascending order of their  handson which are less than the
given handson(int parameter passed) value. if there is no
such course then the method should return null.

The above mentioned static methods should be called from
main methods.

for findAvgOfQuizByAdmin method: The main method
should print the average if the returned value is not 0.
if the returned value is 0 then it should print "No Course
found."


for sortCourseByHandsOn method:
                        the  main method should print the name
of the Course from the returned Course object Array if the
returned value is not null.if the returned value is null then
it should print "No Course found with mentioned attribute."

Problem5:

create a class Footwear which consists of the below attributes.
  footwearId=int
  footwearName=String
  footwearType=String
  price =int

the above attributes should be private.
write getter and setter and parametrised constructor as required.

create the class footwearProgrammm with the main method.
implement the 2 static methods.getCountByType and
getSecondHighestPriceByBrand in the Solution class.


getCountByType method:
   this method will take two input parameters.
array of the Footwear objects and string parameter footwear type.
this method will return the count of the footwears from array of the
footwear objects for the given type of footwear.
if no footwear with the given footwear type is found in the
array of footwear abjects,then the method should return 0.



getSecondHighestPriceByBrand method:
  this method will take 2 input parameters-array of footwear objects and string parameter inputFootwearName.the method
will return the second highest footwear objects based on the price from the array of the Footwear objects


whose brand name matches with the input string parameter.


if no footwear with the given brand is present in the array of the footwear objects,the the method
should return null.

NOTE: no two footwear objects would have the same footwearId.All the searches should be case insensitive.
the above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

for getCountByType method- the main method should print the count of the footwears ,if the returned value
is greater than zero. or it should print "Footwear not available";

for getSecondHighestPriceByBrand method-The main method should print price from the returned footwear objects


if the returned footwear object is not null.else it should print "Brand not available".
for example.
112
ABC
25555
  where 112 is the footwear id,ABC is brand name,25555 is price.

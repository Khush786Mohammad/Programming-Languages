Create class Team with below attributes:

tId - int
tName - String
tCountry - String
tRun - int

The above attributes should be private.Write Getter and Setter and parametrized constructor as required.

Create class Solution with main method.

Implement One static method-

● findPlayer

findPlayer in the solution class. 
This method will take array of Team objects, int paramater run and String country and returns the Team object where taken 
country is matched with the country of team object and team run is greater than the taken run.

Write code to perform following tasks:

1. In main mehod, take 1st input as integer parameter which shows the number of team object.
2. Take necessary input variable and call findPlayer.
3. All searches should be case insensitive.

For this method- The main method should print the team object. As if the returned value is not null, 
or it should print "No team is found from the given country and run".

Find total interest of an amount.

Create a class Account with following attributes :
id - int
balance - double
interestRate - double

Take another integer as number of year. 
After that calculate total interest using formula:

Percentage = interestRate * 100 / time
Total Interest = Percentage + interestRate

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create class Document with below attributes

id - int
title - String
folderName - String
pages - int

Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required. 

Create class Solution with main method. 

Implement static method - docsWithOddPages in Solution class.

This method will take array of Document objects and return another array with Document objects which has odd number of pages. 

This method should be called from main method and display values of returned objects as shared in the sample (in ascending 
order of id attribute). 

Before calling this method, use Scanner object to read values for four Document objects referring attributes in the above 
sequence. 

Next call the method and display the result. 

Consider below sample input and output:

Input:
1
resume
personal
50
2
question1
exams
55
3
question2
exams
45
4
India
misc
40


Output (each line has values separated by single space):
2 question1 exams 55
3 question2 exams 45



Note on using Scanner object:
Sometimes scanner does not read the new line character while invoking methods like nextInt(), nextDouble() etc. 
Usually, this is not an issue, but this may be visible while calling nextLine() immediately after those methods.

Consider below input values:
22
hello

Referring below code:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int x = sc.nextInt();
String str = sc.nextLine(); -> here we expect str to have value hello. Instead it may be """".

If above issue is observed, then it is suggested to add one more explicit call to nextLine() after reading numeric value.

Create a class Music with below attributes:

playListNo - int

type -String

count - int

duration(minutes) -double.



The above attributes should be private.Write Getter and Setter and parametrized constructor as required.

Create class Solution with main method.

****************************************************************************

Implement two static methods: findAvgOfCount and sortTypeByDuration in Solution Class.



findAvgOfCount Method:
----------------------------------------
This method will take an array of Music objects and an int value as input parameters.The method will find out Average 
(as int) of count for those objects whose count is more than the given Count(int parameter passed).This method will return 
average if found.If there is no Type that matches then the method should return 0.

for this method- main method should print average ,if the returned value is not 0.If the returned value is 0 then main method 
should print "No playlist found".

sortTypeByDuration method:
-----------------------------------------
This method will take an array of Music objects and an int value as input parameters.This method should return an array of 
Music objects in an ascending order of their duration which are more than the given duration (int parameter passed) value.
If there are no such objects ,then the method should return null.

for this method-The main method should print the type from the returned Music object array if the returned value is not null.
If the returned value is null then the main method should print "No playlist found with mentioned attribute".

Create a class TravelAgencies with below attributes:

regNo – int
agencyName – String
pakageType – String
price – int
flightFacility – boolean

Write getters, setters for the above attributes . Create constructor which takes parameter in the above sequence.

Create class Solution with main method. Implement two static methods – findAgencyWithHighestPackagePrice and 
agencyDetailsforGivenIdAndType in Solution class.

findAgencyWithHighestPackagePrice method:

This method will take array of TravelAgencies objects as an input parameter and return the highest package 
price from the given array of objects.

agencyDetailsForGivenldAndType method:

This method will take three input parameters -array of TravelAgencies objects, int parameter regNo and String
parameter packageType. The method will return the TravelAgencies object based on below conditions.

FlightFacility should be available.
The input parameters(regNo and packageType) should matched with the regNo and packageType of TravelAgencies object.
If any of the above conditions are not met, then the method should return null. Note : Same Travel agency can 
have more than one package type. Travel agency and package type combination is unique. All the searches should 
be case insensitive.

The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.


For findAgencyWithHighestPackagePrice method – The main method should print the highestPackagePrice as it is. 
For agencyDetailsForGivenldAndType method -The main method should print the AgencyName and price of the returned 
object.The AgencyName and price should be concatinated with : while printing.

Create a class newspaper with below attributes.


regNo-int

name-String

publicationYear-int

price-int



Write parametrised constructor as required.



Create class Solution with main method.

Implement 2 static methods findTotalPriceByPublicationYear and 

searchNewspaperByName in solution class.



findTotalPriceByPublicationYear method:

   This method will take array of the Newspaper objects and int parameter

type.This method will return the total price of newspapers from array of 

Newspaper objects,If the publication year attribute matches with the int 

parameter passed .If no Newspaper with the given publication year is present 

in the array ,then the method should return 0.



The main method should print total price if the returned value is greater 

than 0.Else it should print "No Newspaper found with the mentioned attribute".




searchNewspaperByName method :

   This method will take the array of the Newspaper objects and the String 

parameter type.This method will return the Newspaper object from the Array

of Newspaper objects,If the name attribute matches with the string 

parameter passed.

If no Newspaper with the given name is present in the array ,then the 

method should return null.



The main method should print the regNo,name,year of publication,and price 

if the returned Newspaper object is not null.

else it should print "No Newspaper found with the given name."





The above mentioned static methods should be called from main method.

Create the class RRT(Rapid response team) with the below attributes:

ticketNo-int

raisedBy-String 

assignedTo-String

priority-int

project-String



All attributes should be private,write getters and setters and 

parameterized constructor as required.



Create class MyClass with main method.



Implement a static method-getHighestPriorityTicket in MyClass class.



getHighestPriorityTicket method:

     This method will take an array of RRT objects ,and a String value as parameters.This method will return the RRT object with highest priority
ticket from the array of the RRT objects for the given project(String parameter passed).Highest priority is the one which has lesser value.

for example:1 is considered as high priority and 5 is considered as low priority.

If no RRT with the above condition is present in the array of the RRT objects,then the method should return null.

The main method should print the ticketNo,raisedBy and assignedTo from returned object if the returned object is not null.if the returned object is null then main method should print "No such Ticket".

Problem2:


Create a class Resort with the below attributes:

resortId - int
resortName - String
Category - String 
resortPrice - double
resortRating - double

Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.

Create class Solution with the main method.

Implement two static methods - findAvgPrice in Solution class.

findAvgPrice method:
----------------------------------
This method will take two input parameters - array of Resort objects and a string parameter.
The method will return the average of the prices from resort objects whose Category matched with passed as parameter and rating
will greater than 4.
If no resort present found, then the method should return 0.

Note : All the searches should be case insensitive.

These above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For findAvgPrice method - The main method should print the average price as it is if the returned value is 
greater than 0, or it should print "No such Resort found".

Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four resort objects referring attributes 
in the above mentioned attribute sequence. Next, read the value for category.

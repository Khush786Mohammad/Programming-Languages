Problem1: 

Count the number of words in a sentence that contain at least two consecutive vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in them.
Here's a sample input and output:

Input: I enjoy eating spaghetti and meatballs for dinner
Output: 2

Explanation: There are two words in the sentence that contain at least two consecutive vowels - "enjoy" and "meatballs".

-------------------------------------------

Problem2:

Create a class called Student with the below attributes:

rollNo - int
name - String
branch - String
score - double
dayScholar - boolean

The above attributes should be private, write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required.

Create class Solution with main method.
Implement two static methods -findCountOfDayscholarStudents  and findStudentwithSecondHighestScore in Solution 
class.

findCountOfDayscholarStudents:

This method will take an array of Student objects as an input parameter . This method will calculate and return 
the count of Students whose score is greater than 80 and who are all from dayScholar.

If no Student scored greater than 80 and from dayScholar are present in the array of Student objects, then the
method should return 0.

findStudentwithSecondHighestScore:

This method will take an array of Student objects as an input parameter. This method will return the object 
of the second highest score student from the array of Student objects who are not from the dayScholar.

If no Student is a dayScholar  in the array of Student objects, then the method should return null.

Note : All the searches should be case insensitive.

The combination of dayScholar and score for each student is always unique.

The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For findCountOfDayscholarStudents method - The main method should print the returned count as it is 
if the returned value is greater than 0, else it should print "There are no such dayscholar students".

For findStudentwithSecondHighestScore method - The main method should print the rollNo, name and score 
in the below format from the returned object if the retuned value is not null.

rollNo#name#score

If the returned value is null, then it should print ”There are no student from non day scholar”

Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Student 
objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence. 
Consider below sample input and output:

Input:

1001
Ashwa
IT
85
true
1002
Preeti
IT
70
false
1003
Uma
ECE

false
1004
Akash
EEE
90
true


Output:
2
1002#Preeti#70.0

Problem3:

Create a class College with the below attributes.

 id-int 

 name -String 

 contactNo-int

 address-String 

 pinCode-int



Write the getters and setters and parametrized constructor in the above 

mentioned sequence as required.



Create the class Solution with the main method.

Implement the two static methods:

 1.findCollegeWithMaximumPincode 

 2.searchCollegeByAddress



findCollegeWithMaximumPincode method:

   Create the Static method in the Solution Class.

 This method will take array of the College objects and return the 

College object having maximum pincode if found else return null if not 

found.

   for this method ,main method will print College object with maximum

pincode if the returned value is not null.if the returned value is null ,


then the main method will print "No college found with mentioned attribute".





searchCollegeByAddress method:

   Create the Static method in the Solution Class.

This method will take array of College objects as input and address as 

input and return College object having the mentioned address if found 

else return null if not found.

   for this method main method will print College object details as it is ,

 if the returned value is not null.if the returned value is null then ,


main method will print "No college found with mentioned attribute".

Problem4:


Create a class Motel with the below attributes:

motelId - int
motelName - String
dateOfBooking – String (in the format dd-mon-yyyy)
noOfRoomsBooked – int
cabFacility – String
totalBill- double

Restricted for circulation outside TCS Xplore 6
The above attributes should be private, write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as 
required.
Create class Solution with main method.
Implement one static method – totalNoOfRoomsBooked in Solution class.
totalNoOfRoomsBooked method:
This method will take two input parameter - array of Motel objects and a String parameter.
The method will return the total numbers of rooms booked from array of Motel objects if the cab facility 
attribute matches with the given String parameter(cab facility) and the number of rooms booked is 
greater than 5.
If no rooms are booked with the above criteria in the array of Motel objects, then the method should 
return 0.
Note :
No two Motel object would have the same motelId.
dateOfBooking is stored in the format dd-mon-yyyy(eg. 01-Jan-2022)
The above mentioned static method should be called from the main method.
For totalNoOfRoomsBooked method - The main method should print the total number of booked rooms 
as it is, if the returned value is greater than 0, else it
should print "No such rooms booked"
Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Motel objects 
referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence.
Next, read the value of one String parameter for capturing the cab facility

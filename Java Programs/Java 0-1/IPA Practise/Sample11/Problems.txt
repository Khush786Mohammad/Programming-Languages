Problem1:

Create a class Student with below attributes:

rollNo - int
name - String
subject - String
grade - char
date - String [DD/MM/YYYY]



The above attributes should be private.Write Getter and Setter and parametrized constructor as required.


Create class Solution with main method.
****************************************************************************
Implement one static method: findStudentByGradeAndMonth Solution Class.


findStudentByGradeAndMonth Method:

This method will take an array of Student objects, char value as grade and int value as month 
for input parameters.The method will find out all Students from the given grade and month. 
This method will return array of Student object assending based on their rollNo if found. 
If there is no Student that matches then the method should return null.

for this method- main method should print Student name, subject and total student found [The 
length of the list], if the returned value is not null. If the returned value is null then 
main method should print "No student found".


NOTE:
	1. For Taking char as input use sc.nextLine().charAt(0)
	2. To match/check the month You havee to convert int month in the parameter to String.
	3. No need to count the Student array if return not null just print the array length.

Problem2:

create a class Antenna with below attributes.
antennaid=int
antennaName=String
projectLead=String
antennaVSWR=double

the above attribute should be private ,write getter and setter and parametrized constructor as well.

create class MyClass with main method.
implement two static methods searchAntennaByName and sortAntennaByVSWR in MyClass class.


searchAntennaByName :
---------------------------------------
This method will take an array of Antenna objects and the string value as input parameter.The method will find out Antenna name(String parameterpassed).
It will return Antennaid if found.if there is no Antenna that matches then the method will return zero.
The main method should print the antennaid,if the returned value is not 0.if the returned value is 0 then print,"There is no antenna with the given parameter".


sortAntennaByVSWR:
--------------------------------------
This method will take an array of Antenna Objects and a double value as input.
This method will return an array of Antenna objects sorted in ascending orderof their antennaVSWR, which is less than VSWR(double value passed).       

The main method should print name of the project leads from the returned array if the returned value is not null.if the returned value is null then main method 
should print "No Antenna found";

Problem3:

 Create the class Flowers with below attribute:

flowerId-int;
flowerName-String;
price-int;
rating-int;
type-String;

The above attributes must be private,write getters and setters and parametrized constructor as well.

Create class MyClass with main method.

Implement one static method:findMinPriceByType in MyClass class.

findMinPriceByType Method:

This method will take two input parameters:Array of Flower objects and String parameter.This method will return the minimum 
priced flower object from  array of Flower objects for the given type(String parameter),only if the rating is greater than 
3. If no Flowers with the above conditions are present in the array of the flower objects,then the method will return null.

For this method-The main method  should print the flowerId from the returned object if the returned value is not null.
else it should print "There is no flower with given type".

Problem4:

Create a class Engine with the below attributes:

engineld – int

engineName – String

engine Type – String

enginePrice – double

The above attributes should be private, write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required.

Create class MyClass with main method.

Implement two static methods – findAvgEnginePriceByType and searchEngineByName in MyClass class.

findAvgEnginePriceByType method: This method will take two input parameters Engine objects and String parameter. 
The method will return the average price of Engines from array of Engine objects for the given engine type 
(String parameter passed). If no Engine with the given type is present in the array of Engine objects, then the method 
should return 0.


searchEngineByName method: This method will take a String parameter and an array of Engine objects as the other parameter. 
The method will return Engine object array in an ascending order of their engine ids, from the array of Engine objects whose 
name attribute matches with the given engine name (String parameter passed). If no Engine with the given name is present in 
the array of Engine objects, then the method should return null.

Note: No two Engine object would have the same engine id.

All searches should be case insensitive.

The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For findAvgEnginePriceByType method: The main method should print the average enginePrice of Engines as it is, if the returned 
value is greater than 0, or it should print “There are no engine with given type”.

For searchEngineByName method: The main method should print the engineld from the returned Engine object array if the returned 
value is not null. If the returned value is null, then it should print “There are no engine with the given name”. 

Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Engine objects referring attributes 
in the above mentioned attribute sequence. next, read the value of two String parameters for capturing engine type and engine 
name respectively.

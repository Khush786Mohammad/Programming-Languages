Problem1: Given a number print the reverse of it
eg. num--> 12345
    o/p--> 54321

Problem2:
Create a Class Medicine with the below attributes:
medicine name – String
batch no – String
disease – String
price – int
Write getters, setters, and parameterized constructors as required.
A public class Solution is already created with the main method. 
Code inside the main method should not be altered else your solution might be scored as zero.
You may copy the code from the main method in Eclipse to verify your implementation.
Implement static method – medicinePriceForGivenDisease in Solution class. 
This method will take a String parameter named disease along with the other parameter as an array of 
Medicine objects. The method will return an array of integers containing the price of the medicines in
ascending order if the given input(disease) matches the disease attribute of the medicine objects in the Array.
Note: 
1) Same disease can have more than one medicine.
2) disease search should be case insensitive.
This method should be called from the main method and display the prices.
The main method mentioned above already has Scanner code to read values, create objects, 
and test the above methods. Hence do not modify it.

eq

Disease = Fever

Medicine Objects:

1. Paracetemol, F20, Fever, 120
2. Thyox, GGG9, Thyroid, 780
3. No-Fev, GR2, fever, 59
4. RashFree, W720, Skin Rash, 78
5. Hypo Fever, 788x, FEVER, 98

Problem1:

Create a class Sim with below attributes:

simId - int

customerName - String

balance - double

ratePerSecond - double

circle - String



Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required. 



Public class Solution is already created with main method.


Code inside main method should not be altered else your solution might be 


scored as zero.You may copy the code from main method in eclipse to 

verify your implementation. 





Implement static method - transferCustomerCircle in Solution class.

This method will take first parameter as array of Sim class objects, 

second parameter as circle to be transferred (which is String parameter 

circle1) and third parameter as new circle (which is String parameter 

circle2).



Method will transfer the customer to new circle (circle2), where the

 circle attribute would match second parameter (circle1). 


Method will return array of Sim objects for which circle is transferred.


 Return array should be sorted in descending order of ratePerSecond

 (assuming ratePerSecond is not same for any of the Sim objects).





This method should be called from main method and display the simId,

customerName,circle and ratePerSecond of returned objects 

(as per sample output).



Main method mentioned above already has Scanner code to read values, 

create objects and test above methods. Hence do not modify it.

Problem2:

Create a class Hotel with the below attributes:
 
hotelId - int
hotelName - String
dateOfBooking – String (in the format dd-mon-yyyy)
noOfRoomsBooked – int
wifiFacility – String
totalBill- double



The above attributes should be private, write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required.
 
Create class Solution with main method.
 
Implement two static methods – noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth and searchHotelByWifiOption in Solution class.
 
noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth method:
This method will take two input parameter - array of Hotel objects and a String parameter.
The method will return the total numbers of rooms booked from array of Hotel objects for the given month(String parameter passed).
If no rooms are booked for the given month in the array of Hotel objects, then the method should return 0.



searchHotelByWifiOption method:
This method will take two input parameter - array of Hotel objects and a String parameter
The method will return Hotel object with second highest totalbill, from the array of Hotel objects where wifiFacility attribute 
matches with the given wifi facility(String parameter passed).
If no Hotel with the given wifi option is present in the array of Hotel objects, then the method should return null.
 
Note : 
No two Hotel object would have the same hotelId.
No two Hotel object would have the same totalbill.
The Array either has at least two objects with specified wifi option OR  no object with specified wifi option. 
All the searches should be case insensitive. 
dateOfBooking is stored in the format dd-mon-yyyy(eg. 01-Jan-2022)
 
The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method. 
 
For noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth method - The main method should print the total number of booked rooms as it is, 
if the returned value is greater than 0, else it should print "No rooms booked in the given month"
 
For searchHotelByWifiOption method - The main method should print the hotelId from the returned Hotel object if the returned value is not null. 
If the returned value is null then it should print "No such option available".
 
Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Hotel objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence. 
Next, read the value of two String parameters for capturing the month and wifi option .

--------------------------------------------------
Sample code snippet for reference: 
Please use below code to build your Solution.
--------------------------------------------------
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
 {
    //code to read values 
  //code to call required method
  //code to display the result
 }
    
 //code the first method 
  
    
 //code the second method    

}
    
//code the class

-------------------------------------------------
Note on using Scanner object:
Sometimes scanner does not read the new line character while invoking methods like nextInt(), nextDouble() etc. 
Usually, this is not an issue, but this may be visible while calling nextLine() immediately after those methods.

Consider below input values:
1001
Savings

Referring below code:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int x = sc.nextInt();
String str = sc.nextLine(); -&gt; here we expect str to have value Savings.Instead it may be "".

If above issue is observed, then it is suggested to add one more explicit call to nextLine() after reading numeric value.

Problem3:

Create a class Book with below attributes

id - int

pages - int

title - String

author - String

price - double

The above attributes should be private, write getters and setters and parameterized constructor as required.

Create a class Solution with main method
--------------------------------------------
Implement two static methods - findBookWithMaximumPrice and searchBookByTitle in Solution class.

findBookWithMaximumPrice :
=============================
Create a static method findBookWithMaximumPrice in the Solution class. This method will take array of Book objects and 
returns the Book object having the maximum Price if found else return null if not found.

searchBookByTitle :
=============================
Create a static method searchBookByTitle in the Solution class. This method will take array of Book objects and Title as 
input and returns the Book object having the mentioned Title if found else return null if not found.

These methods should be called from the main method.

write code to perform the following tasks.

1. Take necessary input variable and call findBookWithMaximumPrice. For this method - The main method should print the Book
 object with the maximum of mentioned attribute as it is if the returned value is not null, or it should print 
 "No Book found with mentioned attribute."

2. Take necessary input variable and call searchBookByTitle. For this method - The main method should print the Book object 
details as it is, if the returned value is not null or it should print "No Book found with mentioned attribute."

The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method. Also write the code for accepting the inputs and 
printing the outputs. Don't use any static test or formatting for printing the result. Just invoke the method and print the
result.

All String comparison needs to be in case sensitive.
